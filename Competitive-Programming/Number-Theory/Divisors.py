"""
TIP: model is as a equation

1. A | B => A divides B => B is divisible by A => B % A == 0

2. Divisors (or factors) of X: a number Y where Y | X

3. Transitive: A|B, B|C => A|C

4. Prime: no divisor expect itself

5. Prime factorization: Breaking a number down into a product of primes (or prime powers: P^K for prime P and integer K)

    Ex: 2 = 2, 10 = 2 * 5, 254436 = 2^3 * 3 * 7 * 13 * 233
        27 = 3 * 9 not valid, 9 can be further broken down, 27 = 3^3
