# Youâ€™re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything
# you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want to see it) 
# and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the
# point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your
# stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal
# solution?
